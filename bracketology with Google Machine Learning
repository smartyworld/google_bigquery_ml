-- 4th lab of 5 in "create ML models with bigquery" course

-- task 1 opeing big query console - very basic
-- task 2 examine NCSS March madness - data about college basketball tournaments
-- task 3 adding public datasets - either by searching in "Public Datasets" or adding project "bigquery-public-data" as a "starred" project
-- starring a project appears to mean having it listed, along with its datasets and tables therein, in BigQuery Studio/console
-- task 4 - write query to detmine available seasons and games

SELECT
  season,
  COUNT(*) as games_per_tournament
  FROM
 `bigquery-public-data.ncaa_basketball.mbb_historical_tournament_games`
 GROUP BY season
 ORDER BY season # default is Ascending (low to high)

 -- task 5 - understanding machine learning features and labels
-- inlcudes quesitions about what we know to build the model and what we need to predict
