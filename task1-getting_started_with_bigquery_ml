## this file contains the snippets used in this short course

## task 1 - creating dataset - NA

## task 2 - create the model from data in a public dataset
# standardSQL
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `bqml_lab.sample_model`
OPTIONS(model_type='logistic_reg') AS
SELECT
  IF(totals.transactions IS NULL, 0, 1) AS label,
  IFNULL(device.operatingSystem, "") AS os,

  `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_*`
WHERE
  _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '20160801' AND '20170631'
LIMIT 100000;

## task 3 - evaluate the model you just created
#standardSQL
SELECT
  *
